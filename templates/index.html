                  <p class="card-text"><strong>The development of new technologies in weaponry during World War I had a profound effect on the conduct and outcome of the war. The introduction of machine guns, airplanes, and poison gas on the battlefield greatly increased the destructiveness of warfare and transformed the nature of combat. Airplanes, for instance, allowed for investigation, bombing, and air-to-air combat. Poison gas caused widespread suffering and death, leading to the creation of gas masks for soldiers. These new technologies in weaponry resulted in a higher casualty rate among soldiers and made it increasingly difficult to achieve decisive victories. The horrors of these weapons also led to the international laws regulating the use of warfare technologies. The development of weapons in World War I increased the number of deaths and destruction. According to History Hit, “In 1914-15 German statistics estimated that 49 casualties were caused by artillery to every 22 by infantry, by 1916-18 this was at 85 by artillery for every 6 by infantry.”</strong></p>
