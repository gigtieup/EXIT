      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="card-text"><strong>German scientists created poison gas in 1915 to use in wars. When the gases were first used, the ideas were obtained from the work of Fritz Haber, a director of the Institute for Physical Chemistry at Berlin-Dahlem. He studied ammonia throughout his career to create a weapon for the Germans to use in war. Poison gases were invented to integrate ammonia from the nitrogen in the air. They were installed into trenches and then were released when the wind would blow towards the enemies. The first time poison gas was used in battle was in the Battle of Second Ypres in April of 1915. The French created a phosgene gas from carbonyl chloride which was very potent, and used in this battle. Gas masks could not be produced rapidly enough in order for soldiers' protection. This weapon forced enemy soldiers out of their defensive positions. Poison gas changed the dynamic of war because it would enter the body through the skin, eyes, and stomach. The effects included blisters, irritation, vomiting, effects to the nervous system, and lung problems. Some of the gases led to immediate and fatal effects, such as death and long-term disabilities. Victims who survive poison gas may be out of fighting in war for over a month. This resulted in smaller and weaker armies. Today, poison gas is not used in warfare because of the international law governing the use of chemical weapons in 1925. Many countries such as China, France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union joined the agreement. In the 1970s, Japan and the United States joined.</strong></p>

      <h1 class="text-black"><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></h1>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="card-text"><strong>Poison gas was a devastating weapon used during World War I that caused unimaginable suffering and death on the battlefield. The gas was usually delivered by artillery shells or canisters and would release a cloud of deadly chemicals into the air. The most common types of gas used were chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas. These gases would attack the respiratory system, causing choking, suffocation, and severe burns to the eyes, nose, and throat. The gas would also seep into the soil and linger for days, making the battlefield even more dangerous. Soldiers were given gas masks to protect themselves, but these were often ineffective or cumbersome, leaving many soldiers exposed and vulnerable. The use of poison gas had a profound impact on the tactics and strategies of the war, and its effects can still be felt today in the ongoing efforts to ban the use of chemical weapons in warfare.</strong></p>
